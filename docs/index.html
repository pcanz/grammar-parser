    <h1>Grammar Parsers</h1>

    <p>Grammar rules are often used in specifications, but rarely used in everyday programming. On the other hand, regular expressions are a standard tool that is supported by most modern programming languages. This is despite the fact that regular expressions are cryptic and difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>A grammar parser enables grammar rules to be used in everyday programming. Simpler and better than regular expressions. The grammar rules are a super-set that includes regular expressions, so they can be used to simplify the use of regular expressions. At the same time they open the door to more powerful parsers for context free grammars, and more.</p>

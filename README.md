#   Grit Grammar Parser

A grammmar-parser enables grammar rules to be directly executed in program code. It is a practical tool for programmers that is as easy to use as regular expressions.

The `grammar-parser.js` file is complete and self-contained, it has no external dependencies, and it exports a single function. 

Documentation is in the `docs` folder, see: https://pcanz.github.io/grammar-parser/
